EMR management

The patient\'s diagnostic history can be managed with the help of
blockchain, AI, and ML, technologies. This is for smooth management and
use of data. One such tool collects all the data from patients\'
laboratory reports and prepares a summary report out of it which can be
easily understood and updated in the network. The model architecture
includes - the front end, blockchain, and processing of files
(extraction of data from images). This provides all the required data in
a concise manner which saves time.
